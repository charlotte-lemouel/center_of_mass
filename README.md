# center_of_mass
Calculation of the body center of mass from the kinematics (kinematic) and through optimal combination of kinematic and kinetic information (estimator)

The src folder contains the python code for both the kinematics and the estimator. These can be downloaded using : “pip install center_of_mass”. 

The src-matlab folder contains the matlab code for estimator.

Tutorials and the explanation of the code are in the documentation folder. The documentation is available at: https://center-of-mass.readthedocs.io

Examples are in the example folder.

The performance of the estimator was validated in Le Mouel (2024). The data and code for reproducing the results and figures of this paper are in the validation folder.
